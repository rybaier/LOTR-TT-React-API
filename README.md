# React-API - ?The One App - working title?
### Proposal 
For this project I have decided to use an API that fetches data related to one of the greatest Trilogy's of all time. This App will provide users with random basic information for their journey across Middle Earth, from movie stats and quotes to short snippets of factual info of characters 

- api token was verified using hoppscotch.io (quite a handy tool I have discovered as it also displays the data that is fetched!)
- .env succesfully hidden (note it needs to specifically be in the react app directory not the repo directory  )

## Project Build
Over the course of the project I  was able to maintain my timeline and meet the goals that I set for myself daily. I only ran into a couple of blockers that halted progress until they could be solved. The first was when making multiple api calls and preventing the site from rendering until all the data had been gathered from the various endpoints. Once that was solved utilizing the data was pretty straight forward. It took me a little time to get the function right for pulling from the gathered data at random, once I did then it was straight on until I reached MVP. After I reached mvp I spent my time styling, (which I styled primarily for mobile phones), and then I began to work on stretch goal quiz portion of the quotes, which I was able to finish before presentation time.
