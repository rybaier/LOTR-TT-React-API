# React-API - ?The One App - working title?
### Proposal 
For this project I have decided to use an API that fetches data related to one of the greatest Trilogy's of all time. This App will provide users all the information they could want in their journey across Middle Earth, from movies and quotes to in depth history of characters 

- api token was verified using hoppscotch.io (quite a handy tool I have discovered as it also displays the data that is fetched!)
### User Stories
User wants info on LOTR 
- User wants random facts about characters/movies/quotes - user hits RF button on corresponding page 
- User wants specific LOTR info (stretch)
    - user searches LOTR movies 
    - user searches LOTR character bio
    - user wants in depth character info (provided by wiki-link stored in API object)
    - user searches LOTR famous quotes 
    - user searches LOTR book info
